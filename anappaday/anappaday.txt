- Actual steps most people follow:
	a. Use cases
	b. User stories
	c. UI Design and screen flow
	d. Building App (frontend, backend, databases, environment, deploy...)
	e. Phew!!! Then we need to sell it as well.

4. Sell First. Prototype it before building it!

5. App = function ProtoApp(screens) { 
	
	...;
	return app;
   
   };

6. Prototyping Reddit/HackersNews

7. var screens = UIUXDesigner.getScreens(payThemWell) {
	var screens = [];
	...;
