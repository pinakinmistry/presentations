# Agile Software Development:

## Countless ways to go wrong, only few ways to do it right.
## Software Development Done Right

## Living in era of Digital Disruption:
- Staying Competitive using Technology
- Embrace the change

## Receipe?
- Change: Change is Good.
- Change is hard, easy to say than done.
- That's why we don't embrace it.

## Problem
- Hitler at a software release meeting
- Managers need to become Hitler
- Same story in almost every organization

## Jargons:
- Definition of Ready
- Definition of Done
- Scrum
- Sprint Backlog
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Velocity
- Release Burndown

## Why this Frustration?
- Focus is at the end result and not the process
- We get what we sow

## Frustration => Fun
- Focus on quality of process from the beginning
- Quality without compromise
- Iterative, Evolving Process
- Fail Early, Fail Fast
- Shorter Feedback Loop
